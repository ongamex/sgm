SGM (SG Math library)

//[TODO]Add a proper description.
This is a math library designed for games.

[NOTE]:
The files in "deprecated" folder is not maintained!
The code should work with some modifications, but I cannot guarantee that all functions will work corretly.
There is an SSE implementation and a fallback 'Scalar' version.

That kind of functionaliy will be later added to the sgm library itself. 
target simd interfaces:

SSE, NEON, Scalar fallback
