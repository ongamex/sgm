SGM (SG Math library)

//[TODO]Add a proper description.
This is a math library designed for games.

[NOTE]:
The code "deprecated" folder is not maintained!
The code sould work with some modifications, but I cannot guarantee that all functions work corretly.
There is a SSE implementation and a fallback 'Scalar' version.

That kind of functionaliy will be later added to the sgm library itself.
